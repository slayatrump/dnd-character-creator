  DescriptionParagraphs:
  - 'You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose:
    bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk. lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish
    (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied
    space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though
    it is a celestial, fey or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.'
  - "Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands.
    In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can\u2019t
    attack, but it can take other actions as normal."
  - When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical
    form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.
  - "While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.
    Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar\u2019s eyes and
    hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of
    any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and
    blind with regard to your own senses."
  - As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a
    pocket dimension where it awaits you summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss
    it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it
    to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.
  - "You can\u2019t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell
    while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form.
    Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the
    chosen creature."
  - Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver
    the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet
    of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If
    the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.
