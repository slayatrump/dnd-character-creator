  DescriptionParagraphs:
  - "A creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives everything
    as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if this spell affects it.
    The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated
    and unable to stand up for the duration. A creature with an Intelligence score
    of 4 or less isn\u2019t affected."
  - 'At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can
    make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw
    if it''s triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends. '
