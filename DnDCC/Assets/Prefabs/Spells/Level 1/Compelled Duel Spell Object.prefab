  DescriptionParagraphs:
  - "You attempt to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see
    within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
    is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. For the duration, it has disadvantage
    on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving
    throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away
    from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell doesn\u2019t restrict
    the target\u2019s movement for that turn."
  - The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets
    a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages
    the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than
    30 feet away from the target.
