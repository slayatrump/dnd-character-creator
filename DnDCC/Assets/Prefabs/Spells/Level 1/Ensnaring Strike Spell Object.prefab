  DescriptionParagraphs:
  - The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends,
    a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target
    must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the magical vines
    until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving
    throw. If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.
  - 'While restrained by this spell, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage at the
    start of each of its turns. A creature restrained by the vines or one that can
    touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell
    save DC. On a success, the target is freed. '
  - 'At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. '
