  DescriptionParagraphs:
  - "You make yourself\u2013including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings
    on your person\u2013look different until the spell ends or until you use your
    action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin,
    fat, or in between. You can\u2019t change your body type, so you must adopt a
    form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the
    illusion is up to you."
  - The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For
    example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through
    the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head
    and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone
    who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still
    in midair. To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to
    inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check
    against your spell save DC.
