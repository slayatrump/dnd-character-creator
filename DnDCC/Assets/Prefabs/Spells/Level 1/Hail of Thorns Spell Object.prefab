  DescriptionParagraphs:
  - The next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack before the spell
    ends, this spell creates a rain of thorns that sprouts from your ranged weapon
    or ammunition. In addition to the normal effect of the attack, the target of
    the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving
    throw. A creature takes 1d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much
    damage on a successful one.
  - At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher,
    the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st (to a maximum of 6d10).
