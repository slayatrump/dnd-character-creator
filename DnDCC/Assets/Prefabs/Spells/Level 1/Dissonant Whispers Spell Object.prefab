  DescriptionParagraphs:
  - "You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within
    range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom
    saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately
    use its reaction , if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from
    you. The creature doesn\u2019t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as
    a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and
    doesn\u2019t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on
    the save.  "
  - 'At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st '
