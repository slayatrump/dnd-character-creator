  DescriptionParagraphs:
  - "A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube
    originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
    a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a
    successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn\u2019t pushed."
  - "In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect
    are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell\u2019s effect, and
    the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet. "
  - 'At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st. '
