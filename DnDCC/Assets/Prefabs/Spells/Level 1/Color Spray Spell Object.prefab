  DescriptionParagraphs:
  - "A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 6d10,
    the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures
    in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their
    current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can\u2019t
    see)."
  - "Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature
    affected by this spell is blinded until the spell ends. Subtract each creature\u2019s
    hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest
    hit points. A creature\u2019s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining
    total for the creature to be affected. "
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
    higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.
