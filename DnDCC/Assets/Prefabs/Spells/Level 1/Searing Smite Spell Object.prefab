  DescriptionParagraphs:
  - "The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the spell\u2019s
    duration, your weapon flares with white-hot intensity, and the attack deals an
    extra 1d6 fire damage to the target and causes the target to ignite in flames."
  - 'At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target must make
    a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 fire damage. On a
    successful save, the spell ends. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of
    it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames
    (such as the target being submerged in water), the spell ends. '
  - 'At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
    higher, the initial extra damage dealt by the attack increases by 1d6 for each
    slot '
