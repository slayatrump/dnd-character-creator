  Properties:
  - Thrown (Range 5/15)
  - A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net
    has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger.
    A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself
    or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage
    to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect
    and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to
    attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks
    you can normally make.
